<p>Note taking is one of those universal but intensely personal things.<br>
Everyone takes notes, whether it's as simple as writing down a grocery<br>
list or phone number or as systematic as typing up detailed book<br>
summaries or meeting minutes. For some people, notes are just text—maybe<br>
with a few headings and bullets; for others, they're essentially<br>
scrapbooks with elaborate doodles and images. But however you take notes,<br>
there's an app out there that can handle all your weird quirks, obscure<br> 
preferences, and note-taking needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="concept">
<p>But first, one big thing. You can write notes anywhere: on the back of<br>
a napkin, envelope, important bill, or even in a notebook. It's kind<br>
of similar with apps: you can stick notes into pretty much any old <br>
app, even if it's not really designed for them. Example: Google Docs<br>
isn't a great notes app, but I have notes about this article you're<br>
reading now in the Google Doc I'm working from.As a tech writer,<br> 
I've been taking notes and reviewing software every day for over a<br>
decade. Note taking is something I have opinions about. Even after<br>
10 years, I'm still fine-tuning the system I use. I've done my best<br>
to leave my preferences out of the decision-making process here.<br>
For example, while I love text-heavy notes apps with support for<br>
Markdown (which shouldn't really be a surprise), I recognize that<br>
other people are looking for different things. If your favorite<br>
app isn't on the list, feel free to shout at me.With so many apps<br>
to consider—and so many apps claiming to be notesapps—I had some <br>
pretty strict criteria for what made an app worthy of this list.<br>
First, the best note-taking software has to be good at what it<br>
claims to do. This sounds like an easy bar to clear, but you'd be<br>
surprised at how many apps fell short. Not every note-taking app <br>
needs to have features like image-to-text conversion or stylus <br>
support, but if it boasted about them on its marketing page, they<br>
had better be well-executed and nice to use. Second, all the<br> 
note-taking apps had to be quick and easy to use as intended. <br>
The real competition when you're looking for somewhere to write<br>
a note isn't other note-taking apps, but a pen and scrap of paper.
